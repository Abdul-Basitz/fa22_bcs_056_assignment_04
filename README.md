# Methods

## 1. Sort Descending
### public static void sortDescending(int[] arr)
Takes array of integers as a perimeter and sorts the array in a descending order.


## 2. Calculate Statistics
### public static double[] calculateStatistics(int[] arr)
Takes array of intergers as a perimeter and calculates the statsitics as proposed in the orginal question and returns it in the form of array of doubles named result.


## 3. Matrix Multiplication 
### public static int[][] matrixMultiplication(int[][] matrixA, int[][] matrixB, int rowsA, int columnsA, int columnsB)
Takes multiple perimeters:
1. 2d array of matrix named matrix A.
2. 2d array of matrix named matrixB
3. integer named rowsA
4. integer named columnsA
5. integer named columsB

It multiplies the both matrixes if it can be multiplied and returns the result of the multiplication of matrixA and matrixB named resultMatrix.
